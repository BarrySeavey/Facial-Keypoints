# Facial-Keypoints

This was a competition on Kaggle.  
Given images & locations of facial keypoints (eyes, nose, mouth), build an algorighm that would predict said points on a 'test' set of images (i.e. non-lableld images).

These are some of the iPython notebooks I created.  The names are fairly intuitive as to what they deal with.
The pdf is a small report I made for the class I did this in (PRED454 - Advanced Algorithms).
